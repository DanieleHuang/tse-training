## sprint 3
This sprint is focused on introducing templating and MongoDB. As with the last sprint, keep updating your progress on the repo's Kanban Boards as you go along.

### Introduction to MongoDB

### Project 4: discount-twitter-1
__Description__: *use templating from a .json file to automatically generate site code.*

### Project 5: discount-twitter-2
__Description__: *use templating from MongoDB to add/delete chirps from the site itself.*

__Since other people are going to be on this repo as well, please don't merge anything back into `master`&mdash;just work on your own branch.__
