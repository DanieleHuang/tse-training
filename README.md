# tse-training
Hey y'all. This repo is essentially a crash course to not just web development, but development within a team using an Agile workflow. To this end, the repo is structured as a series of weekly sprints; each sprint focuses on some technologies, and the corresponding directory contains setup guides, tutorials, a couple relevant mini-projects, and additional resources.

Reach out if you're having trouble with any of it and communicate with me if anything comes up that makes it difficult for you to finish tasks in time (e.g. classwork, midterms, breakup, whatever) or if I just underestimated how much time everything would take and assigned an absurd amount of work.
