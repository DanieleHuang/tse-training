Hey y'all. This is just a couple exercises to get you guys a bit more acquainted with the basics of web dev.

Reach out if you're having trouble with any of it and communicate with me if anything comes up that makes it difficult for you to finish tasks in time (e.g. classwork, midterms, breakup, whatever) or if I just underestimated how much time everything would take and assigned an absurd amount of work.

## Agile software development cycle
#### Git
1. If you don't have the Git CLI (do not use GitHub Desktop), run through step 1 of https://www.taniarascia.com/getting-started-with-git/.
2. If you're not too familiar with Git (e.g. you don't quite understand how branches/merging works), complete https://try.github.io.
3. Read https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/.

#### Kanban boards
Just update your progress on the repo's Kanban Boards as you go along. I'll set these up beforehand for everyone. We'll be using the GitHub Marketplace plugin [issue.sh](https://github.com/marketplace/issue-sh) for now, so go ahead and set that up before doing any of the below tasks. Message me on Slack if you have difficulty with that. The plugin should already be set up, with pre-populated and assigned issues for everyone to complete.

#### HTML/CSS/JavaScript
1. If you're not familiar with HTML/CSS, complete https://www.learn-html.org/.
2. If you're not familiar with JavaScript, complete https://www.learn-js.org/.
3. Clone this repo.
4. Create your own branch (duplicate the `master` branch).
5. Complete the two following tasks (and update the Kanban Boards):

__recreate this mockup of a login screen__

Stolen from my old PM [Sean](https://github.com/seannam) (thanks Sean). Mockup:

![login screen mockup](https://github.com/sumeet-bansal/tse-training/blob/master/mockup.png "login screen mockup")

Basically, just recreate that in pure HTML and CSS. Don't worry about getting the colors right.

__tie JavaScript to some buttons__

A stripped-down version of an ECE 140A assignment:
1. Create an HTML page with 4 buttons and some placeholder text.
2. Add a JavaScript file that listens for button clicks and updates the text.

The text can honestly be anything: your NBA playoffs bracket, your explanation of 2001: A Space Odyssey, a single character&mdash;it doesn't really matter. The focus of this is getting the JavaScript events right (which is also why there's no mockup). Feel free to use external libraries and packages (e.g. jQuery for the JavaScript portion, Bootstrap if you care enough to make the page look decent).

__Since other people are going to be on this repo as well, please don't merge anything back into `master`&mdash;just work on your own branch.__
